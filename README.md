# HTML-email -- reflection:
coding for html email is different than web coding mostly in how it's written. much of html email coding is creating inline
styles whereas web coding allows for external stylesheets. additionally many normal element types are not compatible with
some specfic browsers.

i'm honestly not sure about the different types of concepts that coders can use to get around the limitations of html -- 
possibly using inline styles and setting up table elements, rows and data / column information to help get around the styling
limitations that html has.
